# Atrode

Atrode is a protype ofÂ  smart attandence system. It Identifies the "present students" by analysing the attendance carbon sheet. We use python as a main programming
language with OpenCV. At this stage our MINI-PROJECT is detecting the present students, by nominating the highlighted roll numbers and the total number of present students.

Step #1
Take the attandence of the class on the attanence sheet.

Step #2
Separate the Carbon Sheet and Insert as an input in the program.

Step #3
Program will highlight the presents students, by nominating the highlighted roll numbers along with the total number of present students
